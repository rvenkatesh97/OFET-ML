1.transfer train test files to a folder
2. open excel file
3. click JMP on top rigght
4.then click data table
6. Open trainig data table
5. analyze
6.predictice modeling
7.make validation column
8.add property to stratification column
9.Press OK
10.Add random state = 1234
11.Click Go
12. Check the training table and see training and validation written on it
13. Then go to train table and click tables
14. click concatenate
15. Then under opened data tables click test set and then click add under data tables to be concatenated
16. then make sure to provide a name under output table name like ....Joined

24. click and drag Validation column to validation area
25. set random seed as 1234
26. Under modeling options select "Add two way interactions" and "Add quadratics"
27. then click ok
28. Models will now run
29. Should open a seperate window now with all the model results (test and validation are imp)
30. Then under details. select best method. click red arrow. then click save columns. then click save column formula. Now if you go to your joined table, you should see the ypredicted also available
31. Now save the joined table as an excel sheet (For MAPE calc) and as a jmp table for later on comparision.
